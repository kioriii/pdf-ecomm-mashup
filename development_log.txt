  + Successfully followed youtube video to generate a test pdf, and download it
  + Next step - do numbering
  + I don't really understand the code to download though. After using the implicit block generation method, what variable is used?
  + TODO: add pdf metadata (because this is likely going to be used by a law firm)

- Finally figured out why my form submission didn't allow pdf download - it was because of the turbo frames that ruby on rails use. Need to disable that in order to allow a download of pdf
- I think now i want to figure out how to upload pdfs, and manipulate them using Prawn. That gives me a super versatile pdf merging and manipulation service
- But first, let's learn GIT because it will be super important
- Probably will have to start hosting website as well
